// this package parses deployment descriptor files
// and works out the best place to start stuff
// it thus knows about all clusters/dcs/resources
// and makes clever decisions.
// it doesn't actually deploy anything it only figures out where something
// should go
// it is intented that services request their configuration and adjust themselves as needed
// it *might* ping a service if its configuration has changed so it can quickly
// update its configuration

// the name: I'm sick atm and hate birdflu. also - this thing makes software spread like a virus ;)
